# Electronic-Wristband
ðŸ”‹ **Project Overview**

A Coldplay-inspired smart wristband designed for live concerts and events. Our wristband synchronizes light effects via Wiâ€‘Fi, creating immersive crowd experiences. This is the Semester 2 Engineering Design Project (EDP) developed using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and powered by a 3.7â€¯V Liâ€‘Po battery.

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features**

Wiâ€‘Fi Control: Synchronize LED patterns in real time across multiple bands.

Dual LEDs: High-brightness RGB LEDs supporting dynamic color and blink sequences.

Portable Power: 3.7â€¯V Liâ€‘Po battery with 4+ hours runtime.

Lightweight Design: Compact PCB and enclosure for comfort during events.

Openâ€‘Source: Hardware schematics and firmware freely available.

**PCB**
A double layer PCB was designed to hold LEDs, MCU and distribute power.
The PCB was designed to be small enough to fit inside wristband.
